# Stacks Institutional Custody Solution

An enterprise-grade custody solution specifically designed for STX and Stacks-based assets, enabling institutional adoption with proper security protocols and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

This solution addresses a critical gap in the Stacks ecosystem by providing institutional-grade security for STX holdings. By implementing multi-party computation (MPC) key management, hardware security module (HSM) integration, and automated compliance workflows, the platform creates a secure environment for institutions to hold and manage Stacks-based assets.

## Key Features

### Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Key Management
- Threshold signature scheme specifically designed for Stacks
- Distributed key generation and management
- Configurable signature thresholds for different transaction types
- Time-locked transaction approvals

### Hardware Security Module Integration
- Secure key generation and storage
- Transaction signing within secure enclaves
- Defense against physical and network attacks
- Integration with industry-standard HSM protocols

### Compliance Workflow Automation
- Configurable approval workflows based on transaction parameters
- Automated regulatory reporting capabilities
- Transaction monitoring for suspicious activities
- KYC/AML verification integration

### Role-Based Governance
- Fine-grained permission system for different organizational roles
- Hierarchical approval structures
- Audit logging for all administrative actions
- Emergency recovery procedures

## Technical Architecture

The solution consists of several smart contracts working together:

1. **Custody Vault Contract**: Core custody functionality with multi-signature capabilities
2. **Key Management Contract**: MPC key distribution and HSM integration
3. **Compliance Workflow Contract**: Automated regulatory compliance processes
4. **Admin Dashboard Contract**: Role management and audit logs

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [x] Multi-signature vault implementation
- [ ] Transaction proposal and approval workflow
- [ ] Basic role-based access control

## Value to the Stacks Ecosystem

This solution directly benefits the Stacks ecosystem by:

1. Enabling institutional participation in the Stacks ecosystem
2. Providing enterprise-grade security specific to Stacks assets
3. Building infrastructure that encourages institutional capital inflow
4. Creating compliance tools that adhere to regulatory requirements
